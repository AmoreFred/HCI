 HCI and Psychology have symbiotic relationship.
 
 HCI is about resaerch( Needfinding, prototyping and evaluation) and Design( Distributed conginition, mental models, universal designs)
 
 its cyclic form we use reserch to design and vice versa.

 kinestetic stimuli

You are using your kinesthetic sense whenever you are engaged in physical activity such as walking, running, driving, dancing, swimmingâ€”anything that requires body movement. When you compress or tense your muscles, they detect and communicate sensory information about movement and posture

*Introduction to Principles*

User and task through the interface -

1. Understand the task
2. Thermostat- Controlling the temperature - Check nest as a device 

1. Watch real users 
2. Talk to them
3. Start small- individual interactions 
4. Abstract up- why they are doing this 
5. You are not the user 


Usability is important 


Processor - sensory processor - fits within human limits - physically usable. quantative experiments are conducted 

Predicor - they will be mapping - fit with their knowledge , qualitative studies,

Participant - fit with the context - in situ studies - navigation maps on real road
